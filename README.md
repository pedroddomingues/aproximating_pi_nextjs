This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Aproximating pi!
This project uses the Monte Carlo method to aproximate the value of pi.

I haven't been programming with React for months so there is a lot to improve.
If you have any suggestion please contact me or open an issue.

The design is not my passion but I did my best.
